        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hi! My name is Jacky Koo and I am a full stack developer. After working 10 years in the Healthcare industry, I decided to sought out a career that will allow me to utilize the skills I’ve gain over the years to make a bigger impact in the world. After learning about the tech industry and specially the field of web development, I began a few month of self-studying and realized I have great passion for this field. I eventually enrolled in General Assembly and recently graduated as a full stack developer. <br />
        As someone who enjoys challenges and problem solving, it allows me to utilize different angles to look at a problem and find different way to achieve the best results as a developer. My passion for helping other and my background in healthcare leads to my attention to detail and the ability to focus on creating the most user friendly experience for clients. I’m excited for the upcoming opportunities and challenges that will allow me to create a meaningful experience for others. </p>
